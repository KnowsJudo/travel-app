# Travel App Website

Web tool that makes use of multiple APIs to display weather conditions during a future time period submitted by the user. The days of the week, temperature range and general weather forecast will be shown over the time period selected.

## Extended project features

Contains both a start and end date and displays the total length of the trip in days. Also contains a reset button for the user to remove the trip if desired.

## Project Files

I have attempted to refactor each js file within the project in a logical way whereby each one serves their own specific purpose, i.e. all get and set files together within html.js, all event listeners within main.js etc.

## Installation

Run the following command to initialise the project:

```
npm i
```

Run the following command to start the webserver(port 8080):

```
npm run start
```

To run functionality tests with Jest use command:

```
npm run test
```

To run the project in production mode use command:

```
npm run build
```

To run the project in development mode use command:

```
npm run dev
```

The project contains its own linting tool with command:

```
npm run lint
```
